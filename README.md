SmartWealthAdvisor
==================

A detailed README for the Stacks Clarity smart contract, **SmartWealthAdvisor**, a decentralized wealth management system.

* * * * *

üí° Overview
-----------

The `SmartWealthAdvisor` contract provides a decentralized platform for wealth management, allowing users to create investment portfolios, track their growth, and receive risk-adjusted investment recommendations. It incorporates a sophisticated fee structure, including both annual advisory fees and performance fees on realized gains, all managed transparently on the Stacks blockchain. The system utilizes predefined investment strategies linked to user-selected risk levels (Conservative, Moderate, Aggressive) to provide actionable guidance and comprehensive performance reports.

üõ†Ô∏è Contract Details
--------------------

This contract is written in **Clarity**, the smart contract language for the Stacks blockchain.

### Data Structures

| **Map/Variable** | **Key** | **Value/Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `portfolios` | `principal` (user address) | `{total-invested: uint, current-value: uint, risk-level: uint, last-updated: uint, advisory-fees-paid: uint, strategy-id: uint, active: bool}` | Stores all vital user portfolio data. |
| `investment-strategies` | `uint` (Strategy ID) | `{name: (string-ascii 50), min-risk: uint, max-risk: uint, target-return: uint, recommended-allocation: (list 5 uint)}` | Stores details for predefined investment strategies. |
| `growth-history` | `{user: principal, period: uint}` (User & Block Height) | `{value: uint, growth-rate: int, timestamp: uint}` | Logs the portfolio value and growth rate at the time of report generation. |
| `total-aum` | `uint` | Tracks the **Assets Under Management** (total value of all active portfolios). |  |
| `strategy-counter` | `uint` | A simple counter for new investment strategies (currently initialized to `u3`). |  |
| `platform-fees-collected` | `uint` | Accumulates total fees collected by the platform. |  |

### Constants & Configuration

The contract is configured with key financial and system constants:

| **Constant** | **Value** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `advisory-fee-rate` | `u100` (100 basis points) | **1.00%** annual advisory fee. |
| `performance-fee-rate` | `u2000` (2,000 basis points) | **20.00%** fee on portfolio gains. |
| `min-investment` | `u1000000` | Minimum required initial investment (1 STX, assuming 1 STX = 1,000,000 micro-STX). |
| `risk-conservative` | `u1` | Risk level identifier for Conservative strategy. |
| `risk-moderate` | `u2` | Risk level identifier for Moderate strategy. |
| `risk-aggressive` | `u3` | Risk level identifier for Aggressive strategy. |

### Public Functions (Entrypoints)

| **Function** | **Access** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `initialize-strategies` | Owner-only | Sets up the initial **Conservative (u1)**, **Moderate (u2)**, and **Aggressive (u3)** strategies with their respective target returns and recommended asset allocations. |
| `create-portfolio` | Public | Allows a user to establish a new portfolio with an `initial-investment` (must be $\ge u1000000$) and a `risk-level` (1, 2, or 3). Assigns a recommended strategy and updates `total-aum`. |
| `update-portfolio-value` | Public | Simulates market movement by allowing a user to update their `current-value`. *Note: In a real-world scenario, this would likely be an Oracle-fed or governance-controlled function.* |
| `generate-wealth-growth-report` | Public | Produces a detailed report for a user, calculating absolute gain, growth rate, performance-vs-target, and a **Sharpe Ratio** (risk-adjusted return approximation). It also issues a simple recommendation and logs the performance to `growth-history`. |

### Read-Only Functions

| **Function** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `get-portfolio` | Retrieves the portfolio data for a given `principal`. |
| `get-strategy` | Retrieves the details of a specific investment strategy by its ID. |
| `get-fees-owed` | Calculates the current advisory and performance fees owed by a user based on time elapsed since last update and current gains. |

### Private Functions (Core Logic)

| **Function** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `calculate-advisory-fee` | Computes the daily pro-rata advisory fee based on `portfolio-value`, using the annual `advisory-fee-rate` (1% per year) and `days-elapsed`. (Assumes 144 blocks $\approx$ 1 day). |
| `calculate-performance-fee` | Calculates the performance fee (20%) on any positive difference between `current-value` and `initial-value`. |
| `is-valid-risk-level` | Utility to validate that the provided risk level is between 1 and 3. |
| `calculate-growth-rate` | Computes the percentage growth/loss from `initial` to `current` value, expressed as a signed integer in **basis points (bps)**. |
| `get-recommended-strategy` | Maps the user's selected risk level (`u1`, `u2`, or `u3`) to the corresponding default `strategy-id`. |

üìà Financial and Analytical Logic
---------------------------------

### Fee Calculation

The contract charges two types of fees:

1.  Advisory Fee: An annual fee of 1.00% of the portfolio's current-value, calculated pro-rata based on the time elapsed (in days) since the portfolio was last updated (last-updated).

    $$\text{Annual Fee} = \frac{\text{Portfolio Value} \times \text{Advisory Fee Rate}}{10000}$$

    $$\text{Daily Fee} = \frac{\text{Annual Fee}}{365}$$

    $$\text{Fee Owed} = \text{Daily Fee} \times \text{Days Elapsed}$$

2.  Performance Fee: A fee of 20.00% on realized gains. This is only charged on the total positive gain (i.e., current-value > total-invested).

    $$\text{Performance Fee} = \frac{(\text{Current Value} - \text{Total Invested}) \times \text{Performance Fee Rate}}{10000}$$

### Performance Metrics

The `generate-wealth-growth-report` function provides advanced metrics for a comprehensive review:

-   Growth Rate (in bps): Measures the total percentage change in portfolio value.

    $$\text{Growth Rate (bps)} = \frac{(\text{Current} - \text{Initial}) \times 10000}{\text{Initial}}$$

-   **Performance vs. Target (Gap):** Compares the actual `growth-rate` against the strategy's predefined `target-return` in basis points.

-   **Sharpe Ratio (Approximation):** A basic risk-adjusted return metric is calculated, which serves as a rough proxy for comparing returns relative to the portfolio's specified risk level.

    -   For risk levels $\gt u1$: $\text{Sharpe Ratio} \approx \frac{\text{Growth Rate (bps)}}{\text{Risk Level} \times 100}$

    -   For risk level $u1$: $\text{Sharpe Ratio} = \text{Growth Rate (bps)}$ (simplification)

### Recommendation Logic

The automated investment recommendation is based on how the portfolio is performing relative to its target return:

| **Condition** | **Performance Gap** | **Recommendation** | **Action Implied** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Underperforming** | `< -500` (underperforming target by $>5.0\%$) | `"REBALANCE-INCREASE-RISK"` | Suggests seeking higher returns, potentially by adjusting the risk level. |
| **Overperforming** | `> 1000` (overperforming target by $>10.0\%$) | `"SECURE-PROFITS"` | Suggests taking some capital off the table to lock in gains. |
| **On Track** | All other cases | `"MAINTAIN-STRATEGY"` | Continue with the current investment plan. |

üöÄ Usage Guide
--------------

### Setup

1.  **Deploy the Contract**: Deploy the Clarity code to the Stacks blockchain.

2.  **Initialize Strategies**: The contract owner must call `(initialize-strategies)` once to populate the `investment-strategies` map with the predefined risk profiles.

### User Flow

1.  **Create Portfolio**: Call `(create-portfolio u2000000 u2)` (Example: $2$ STX investment, Moderate risk).

2.  **Monitor/Update**: As market conditions change, the user or an automated process calls `(update-portfolio-value u2200000)` to reflect the new market value.

3.  **Generate Report**: The user calls `(generate-wealth-growth-report tx-sender)` to get their performance analysis, risk-adjusted metrics, and investment recommendation. This also logs the current performance snapshot.

4.  **Check Fees**: The user can check their fee obligations with `(get-fees-owed tx-sender)`. *Note: A separate function for fee collection and transfer would be implemented in a complete system.*

üîí Error Codes
--------------

| **Code** | **Constant** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `u100` | `err-owner-only` | The transaction sender is not the contract owner. |
| `u101` | `err-not-found` | Portfolio or strategy ID does not exist. |
| `u102` | `err-insufficient-balance` | Not used in current version, but reserved. |
| `u103` | `err-invalid-amount` | Initial investment is below `min-investment` or `new-value` is zero. |
| `u104` | `err-unauthorized` | Portfolio is inactive. |
| `u105` | `err-invalid-risk-level` | Risk level provided is not 1, 2, or 3. |

ü§ù Contribution
---------------

We welcome contributions to enhance the `SmartWealthAdvisor` contract. Before making significant changes, please open an issue to discuss what you would like to change.

### Guidelines:

1.  **Clarity Best Practices**: All code must adhere to Clarity language best practices, focusing on safety and predictability.

2.  **Gas Efficiency**: Optimize functions for low transaction costs.

3.  **Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests covering all public functions and edge cases (especially fee calculation and error handling) are required for any pull request.

4.  **Feature Scope**: Proposed features should align with the core mission: decentralized, risk-adjusted wealth tracking and advice.

### Suggested Enhancements:

-   Implementation of token transfers for initial investment, fee collection, and withdrawal.

-   More granular risk-adjusted metrics (e.g., proper Sharpe Ratio with a risk-free rate, Sortino Ratio).

-   Adding a governance mechanism for updating strategies or fee rates.
